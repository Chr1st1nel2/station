The source code is written in C++ and will compile using make with the
Makefile provided. The SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf and OpenGL 2.0 libraries are
required for a successful build. Also random crashes may occur if the data
directory is not intact.

See the report for Bugs and Known Issues.

A quick overview of the source code: most of the main shadow determining
algorithm is contained in renderer.cpp. The main function and classes is
contained in station, which itself inherits from the class contained in
basegame.cpp Maths classes are contained in the math/ folder. The obj/ folder
contains the code and grammar used to load *.OBJ files. The model/ directory
contains classes relevant to the modelling of the scene (lights, camera,
model etc). In the material/ folder are abstractions for Textures and Shaders.
And lastly the font/ folder contains a class for rendering textured fonts to
the screen.
